# Installation

`pip install fito`


# Functionality

Fito is a package that works around the concept of four concepts:
First there are `Specs`. A `Spec` specifies an object.
It provides the capability of specifiyng things, like models or data sources.
Also an `Spec` can be combined with another `Spec` which allows them to specify
things like experiments that combine both models and data sources.
Specs are both **json-serializable** and **hasheable**.
  
An `Operation` is an spec that computs something out of it. Can be though
as a [currified function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying#Illustration)

That leads us to the `DataStore`, whose capability is to index an `Spec`.
There are two implementations, one that uses the file system and 
anotherone that uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

One nice combination of having this abstraction, is that we can do automatic caching.
That can be performed with both of these decorators

* `as_operation` Decorator that turns any function into a subclass of `Operation`
* `DataStore.cache`: Decorator to turn automatic caching on any function. 
Creates an operation out of the function and the data store is used for caching the results. 
* Both decorators can be used for functions, instance and class methods.

# How does it look like?
It looks like this
```
from fito.data_store.file import FileDataStore
ds = FileDataStore('test') # can be reeplaced by MongoHashMap

@ds.cache()
def f(x, y=1):
    print "executed"
    return x + y
```

That code is enough to cache the executions of `f` into the file system

You can see more examples here:
* A [simple execution flow](https://github.com/elsonidoq/fito/blob/master/examples/Simple%20Flow.ipynb): 
Shows how operations can be used to express entities linked together by their execution

* The [auto caching decorator](https://github.com/elsonidoq/fito/blob/master/examples/Auto%20Caching.ipynb): 
Shows how operations joint with data stores can be used for automatic function caching

* The [execution FIFO](https://github.com/elsonidoq/fito/blob/master/examples/Expensive%20computations.ipynb): 
Shows how we can leverage on execution cache to avoid recomputing recently executed operations
